## üöÄ Introduction to Starknet
**Starknet** is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, built using STARK proofs. It enables fast, secure, and low-cost transactions, and supports complex dApps with high throughput.

### Why Starknet?
- Scales Ethereum with lower fees and higher speed
- Uses Cairo, a custom language for provable computation
- Features account abstraction (smart contract wallets by default)
- Unique fee model: fees are paid in ETH, but the structure is different from L1

### How Starknet Differs
- Uses Cairo instead of Solidity
- All accounts are smart contracts (account abstraction)
- Data is event-driven and more flexible, but sometimes less standardized than EVM chains

## üèóÔ∏è Platform Overview
### Purpose
- Starklytics Suite is a data analytics and bounty platform for Starknet

### Who is it for?
- Web2 analysts, Web3 researchers, Starknet ecosystem participants, and anyone interested in on-chain data

### App Flow
1. **Query:** Write and run queries on Starknet data
2. **Save:** Store queries and results for later use
3. **Visualize:** Build charts and dashboards from query results
4. **Dashboard:** Organize and share your analytics
5. **Share:** Collaborate and publish dashboards

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Explanation
### How Starknet Data Works
- Data is stored in native tables, contracts, and events
- Interactions are decoded from calldata and event logs
- Events are the main source for analytics (not logs like EVM)

### Example Queries
\`\`\`sql
-- Find all active bounties
SELECT * FROM bounties WHERE is_active = true;

-- Get total rewards distributed
SELECT SUM(reward_amount) FROM bounties WHERE winner IS NOT NULL;

-- Active participants in last 7 days
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT participant) FROM bounty_participants 
WHERE joined_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
\`\`\`

## üõ†Ô∏è Smart Contract Integration
### Bounty Contract Events
- \`BountyCreated\`: When a new bounty is posted
- \`BountyJoined\`: When a participant joins
- \`SolutionSubmitted\`: When solutions are submitted
- \`RewardDistributed\`: When rewards are paid out

### Example Event Query
\`\`\`sql
-- Track all bounty solutions
SELECT 
  bounty_id,
  participant,
  solution_hash,
  block_timestamp
FROM solution_submitted_events
ORDER BY block_timestamp DESC;
\`\`\`

## üí° Getting Started
1. Connect your Starknet wallet (Argent X or Braavos)
2. Browse active bounties in the Bounties section
3. Start with basic queries in Query Editor
4. Build your first dashboard
5. Join the community discord for support
